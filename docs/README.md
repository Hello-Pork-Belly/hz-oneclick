# Documentation Overview

This docs folder provides reference information for the scripts in this repo.
All example paths use placeholders. Replace them with your own site identifier
(e.g. `your-site`) and domain name (e.g. `abc.yourdomain.com`).
Replace placeholder domains with your real domain.

## Default install paths (placeholders)

| Purpose | Example path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WordPress site root | `/var/www/your-site/html` | Replace `your-site` with your site slug. |
| WordPress vhost base | `/var/www/your-site` | Parent directory that contains `html/`. |
| OpenLiteSpeed install | `/usr/local/lsws` | Default OLS installation directory. |
| Script working dir | `/opt/hz-oneclick` | Example location if you clone locally. |

If you use a custom layout, keep it consistent across scripts and update any
references accordingly.
